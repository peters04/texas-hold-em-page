                    Limit poker is a science, but no-limit is an art. In limit, you are shooting at a target. In no-limit, the target comes alive and shoots back at you. — Crandell Addington

                <p><b>Texas Hold’em</b> is played using a <strong>standard 52 card deck</strong>, and between <em>two to ten players</em>. Big
                    tournaments may include <small>many hundreds of players</small> but during <sub>any one hand</sub>, <sup>the player is only
                    competing against others on his or her table.</sup>

                    Before every hand, one player is designated the nominal “dealer”, identified by a marker known as
                    the dealer button or “button”. This person does not actually deal the cards – especially not online,
                    where it is done automatically – but the position of the dealer determines which two players have to
                    post the “blind” bets that get the action started.

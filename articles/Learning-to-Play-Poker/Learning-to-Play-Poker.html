                    <h2>THE POKER BASICS COURSE</h2>
                    <p>The Poker Basics Course is the first step for new players and it’s a great way to learn poker. It
                        will guide you through everything you need to know as a beginner, starting with some simple poker
                        definitions and the rules of the game. It takes you through some key concepts of play, and then
                        gradually examines some examples of how to apply the knowledge you’re learning in real poker
                        situations.
    
                        It might seem like a lot – at least at the beginning – but there are plenty of opportunities to get
                        involved and give you confidence for when you first take a seat at the table. You will find our
                        unique hand replayer embedded in some articles, which freeze the action at key stages in poker hands
                        and allow you to make a decision, giving guidance towards the correct play.
    
                        The course is divided into chapters, comprising of several linked lessons. Although most of the
                        course is designed to be read and understood in chronological order, there are some times you may
                        want to go back to refresh your memory of previous lessons.
    
                        All of what you learn in the Poker Basics course is crucial, regardless of what order you read it.
                        If things don’t seem to be going so well, you should go back and review.
    
                        The Poker Basics course is the foundation on which your poker game will be built, so make sure those
                        foundations are rock solid.</p>

                    <h2>POKER VARIANTS</h2>
                    <p>There are many different variants of the game of poker, some of which seem similar but have
                        specific quirks and different strategy. In old-school gangster movies, for example, they might
                        be playing games known as five-card draw or seven-card stud, while some of today’s whizz kids
                        could be playing Omaha hi-lo, with any number of their own personal rules tagged on.

                        But let’s forget about all of those for a moment. By far the most common poker variant is no
                        limit Texas Hold’em – sometimes abbreviated to NLHE. Specifically, this is the game where each
                        player receives two personal “hole” cards and can bet all of their chips at any time.</p>

                    <div class="center-image"><img src="img/history-poker_v3.jpg" alt=""></div>

                    <p>All of the rules and mechanics of the game will be explained as this course progresses, but bear
                        in mind that when we are talking about “poker”, we are almost always talking about no limit
                        Texas Hold’em, unless otherwise stated. It is the easiest variant to learn and is justifiably
                        the most popular.

                        Most televised tournaments are NLHE competitions, including main events on the European Poker
                        Tour (EPT), Latin America Poker Tour (LAPT), Asia Pacific Poker Tour (APPT) and all other
                        regional PokerStars tours. The main event of the World Series of Poker, held in Las Vegas every
                        year, is also a no limit Texas Hold’em tournament.

                        If you see two concealed “hole” cards in front of a player, he or she is playing Texas Hold’em.
                        You will find hundreds of Texas Hold’em tables on offer when you first look round the PokerStars
                        lobby.</p>

                    <h2>No Limit or Fixed Limit</h2>
                    <p>As stated above, the beginner’s courses at PokerStars School focus almost exclusively on no limit
                        Texas Hold’em. It is therefore important to understand what “no limit” means in a poker context.

                        In some games – known as fixed limit or pot limit – players are permitted to bet only a very
                        specific amount, determined by the pre-arranged level of the game. But “no limit” means that
                        there are no betting restrictions: no matter how many chips you have in front of you during a no
                        limit game, you are allowed to bet them all whenever it is your turn.

                        Crucially, you are not allowed to bet any more than you have in front of you. You cannot reach
                        into your pocket, or visit the PokerStars cashier, when you are in the middle of a hand. But if
                        you have the chips on the table, you can wager them all at any time in a no limit game.

                        As a result of this betting freedom, no limit games can be quite volatile. Players can lose all
                        their chips – or double their stack – in only one hand. Later in the course, we deal with the
                        crucial concepts of bankroll management, which will ensure you do not go broke. But for the time
                        being remember that a no limit game means that all your chips are in play all the time, so be
                        careful and learn at the play money, or low-limit, tables.</p>

                    <h2>Tournament v Cash Play</h2>
                    <p>Even at this very early stage in your poker career, it is worth understanding the difference
                        between “cash” and “tournament” poker. PokerStars School covers both in some depth in later
                        courses, but it is important to know what separates the two.ű

                        In short: a cash game is played with chips that have a real cash value and players join and
                        leave the game at any time they please. Essentially a cash game is endless, with the
                        participants changing continually as play progresses.

                        Cash games take place around only one table. You play a cash game only against the players
                        beside whom you are seated, and if you don’t like those opponents, you can get up and find
                        another game.

                        (Note: there is not any actual cash on the table. All poker is played using chips, or online
                        where your balance is indicated on the screen.)</p>

                    <h2>Cash Games or Tounament Poker – Which is best?</h2>
                    <p>TBy contrast a tournament is played in accordance with a very strict and pre-defined structure,
                        costing a specific entrance fee. Any number of players can enter, and players in a tournament
                        are spread across as many tables as it takes to fit them in.

                        A tournament is completed when a player has either lost all his chips or has won everyone
                        else’s.

                        At the beginning of a tournament, all the players exhange an entry fee for a number of
                        tournament chips. Everyone is charged the same amount to enter, and everyone gets the same
                        number of chips. From then on, these chips are the only currency that matters. Tournament chips
                        have no cash value from the moment the tournament begins.

                        The champion – ie, the player who is never knocked out and accumulates all the others’ chips –
                        takes the biggest slice of a prize pool, with money also going to an agreed percentage of the
                        top-placed finishers. Second place will win an agreed amount; third place slightly less, and so
                        on.</p>

                    <div class="center-image"><img src="img/Branding_0030-1024x576.jpg" alt=""></div>

                    <p>
                        When you see poker champions waving a huge check at the end of a tournament, their prize
                        comprises the lion’s share of the total money wagered by all the players who were knocked out
                        along the way.

                        Tournaments follow an agreed format, and the key factor is the advertised entry fee. A $3
                        tournament might follow the same structure as a $300 tournament: entrants might get, say, 3,000
                        tournament chips for their original investment and play would proceed in precisely the same
                        manner.

                        Things are markedly different in a cash game, where there is no fixed moment at which it must
                        end, nor a pre-defined fee. Players can typically buy back in to a cash game if they lose their
                        chips, a practice that only applies in some specific tournaments.

                        Later courses at PokerStars School cover single table tournaments (STTs) and multi-table
                        tournaments (MTTs). There is also a specific cash game course. But first, the basics, which will
                        apply whatever type of poker you choose to play.
